# = Comment. Also called: Pound, hash, octothrope, mesh. They can go above your code or after you code like this: print "Test" #printing test
# ^ = Carrot
# SyntaxError = Tells us what that error might be. Usually they are cryptic, but if you google them you will find the answer most of the time.
# print = displays the text you define on the screen

# Math Symbols:
# + = Plus (for adding)

# / = slash (for dividing)
# * = asterisk aka star (for multiplying)
# % = percent
# < = less-than
# > = grater-than
# <= = less-than-equal
# >= = greater-than-equal

# floating-point number = numbers with a decimal e.g.: 1000.0 is a floating point number

# variable = a symbolic name given to some known or unknown quantity or value. Programmers use variables to make their code read more like english.

# _ = underscore character. We use this character to put an imaginary space between words in variable names.

# string = Everytime you put "" aka double quotes around a piece of text you make a string. You print them, save them to files, send them to servers, etc.

# multi-line string = """
# this is an example of a multi-line string
# """

# Format strings:
# %r = print this no matter what
# %s = Allows me to insert (and potentially format) a string
# %d = serves as a placeholder for a signed integer decimal value.   

# \n = new line
# \t = tab

# "I am 6'2\" tall."  # escape double-quote inside string
# 'I am 6\'2" tall.'  # escape single-quote inside string

# raw_input() = allows the user to input characters.

# pydoc = allows you to view help documents about any python function. e.g. pydoc raw_input

# open = Open a file using the file() type, returns a file object.
# file = Open a file.  The mode can be 'r', 'w' or 'a' for reading (default), writing or appending. 

# Modules (Libraries) - e.g.: from sys import argv
# os = operating system routines for Mac, NT, or Posix depending on what system we're on.
# os.path = Common operations on Posix pathnames.
# sys = This module provides access to some objects used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
# * argv = command line arguments e.g. $ python text.py argument

# close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
# read -- Reads the contents of the file, you can assign the result to a variable.
# readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.
# truncate -- Empties the file, watch out if you care about the file.
# write(stuff) -- Writes stuff to the file.

# def = Function definition. Allows you to create your own functions (mini scripts, tiny commands)

# To 'run', 'call', or 'use' a function all mean the same thing.

# '+=' = adds another value with the variable's value and assigns the new value to the variable. (Shorthand notation)

# return = to set variables to be a value from a function
